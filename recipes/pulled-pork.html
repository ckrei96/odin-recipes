        <h2 id="pork-header2">Instant Pot Pulled Pork is seasoned to perfection, and mouthwateringly tender! </h2>

            <p>Pulled pork is a very simple dish to make at home, and there are a few ways to make it even more quick and easy.</p>

            <p>Once you have seasoned your meat, you will mix up your wet ingredients.  I prefer to use broth over water for added flavor.  Use your favorite type of barbecue sauce, and then a bit of apple cider vinegar.  The vinegar not only adds great flavor, but, the acid helps to tenderize the meat as it cooks!</p>

            <p>After you have seasoned your meat, and mixed up your wet ingredients it's time to get cooking!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>

                   <li>1/4 Teaspoon Cayenne, Optional</li>
                   <li>3 Pound Boneless Pork Roast, Cut into 3-4 inch cubes</li>
                   <li>2 Tablespoons Olive Oil</li>

                   <li>2 Cups Barbecue Sauce, Divided</li>
                   <li>1 1/4 Cup Chicken or Beef Broth</li>
                   <li>1 Teaspoon Hot Pepper Sauce, Optional</li>
            </ul>



            <h3>Directions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a small bowl mix together the brown sugar, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, cumin, and cayenne.</li>
                    <li>Season the cubed pork with the spice mixture and set aside.</li>
                    <li>In a medium bowl whisk together the apple cider vinegar, one cup of the barbecue sauce, the hot pepper sauce if using, and one cup of the broth.</li>
                    <li>Turn your instant pot to the saute setting. Add the olive oil and allow it to get hot.</li>
                    <li>Add half of the cubed pork to the hot oil and saute for 5 minutes, turning to brown on all sides. Remove the browned pork to a plate and repeat with the remaining half of the cubed pork.</li>
                    <li>Turn the instant pot off.  Use the remaining Â¼ cup of beef broth and a wooden spoon to deglaze (scrape the brown bits) from the bottom of the pot.</li>
                    <li>Add all of the meat along with the barbecue sauce mixture to the instant pot.</li>

                    <li>Cook on manual high pressure for 40 minutes. Once the cooking time is up, allow the pressure to release naturally for 10 minutes, then do a quick release.</li>
                    <li>Remove the meat from the instant pot and shred.  Stir in the remaining cup of bbq sauce and serve on buns as desired.</li>
                </ol>
