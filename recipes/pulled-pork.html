        <h2>Instant Pot Pulled Pork is seasoned to perfection, and mouthwateringly tender! </h2>

            <p>Pulled pork is a very simple dish to make at home, and there are a few ways to make it even more quick and easy.</p>

            <p>Once you have seasoned your meat, you will mix up your wet ingredients.  I prefer to use broth over water for added flavor.  Use your favorite type of barbecue sauce, and then a bit of apple cider vinegar.  The vinegar not only adds great flavor, but, the acid helps to tenderize the meat as it cooks!</p>

            <p>After you have seasoned your meat, and mixed up your wet ingredients it's time to get cooking!</p>
