        <h2 id="cookie-header2">These are the best oatmeal cookies, with rich buttery flavor, a hint of cinnamon, and lots of chewy oatmeal texture.</h2>

            <p>They’re not fancy. They’re not even very pretty. They’re just basic drop cookies filled with oats and a hint of cinnamon. Dessert possibly couldn’t get any less sophisticated.</p>

            <p>BUT, sometimes simple is best. And these chewy oatmeal cookies really are the best. They’ve got a great chewy texture, delicious buttery-brown sugar flavor, and they’re so nostalgic. I dare you to stop at just one!</p>

            <h3>Directions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 350°F. Line sheet pan with parchment paper.</li>
                    <li>In bowl of stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment, or in large bowl with hand-held mixer, beat butter, brown sugar and sugar until creamy, about 2-3 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, mixing after each. Add vanilla and mix until well combined.</li>
                    <li>In medium bowl, combine flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and oats. Add to butter mixture all at once and mix on low until combined.</li>
                    <li>Use a medium (1½ tablespoon) or large cookie scoop (3 tablespoon) to portion dough and arrange a few inches apart on sheet pans lined with parchment paper.</li>
                    <li>Bake until edges just begin to turn golden, about 8-10 minutes for smaller cookies, 10-12 minutes for larger cookies.</li>
                    <li>Repeat with remaining cookie dough.</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle baked cookies with coarse salt, if desired. Let cookies cool on the sheet pan for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy within a few days!</li>
